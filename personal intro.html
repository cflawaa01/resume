  <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Many people have question about what my first name is. Officially, my first name is Chung-Fai. However, I prefer to be 
    called Chung in everyday life.
    I had been living in Hong Kong since I was born until Nov 2020, which was just before the break out of covid.
     Due to the fact that Hong Kong was still a British colony at the time I was born, I possess a British National(Overseas)
    identity which grants me the right to live and work in the UK.<br/>
    To be honest, It was a great challenge to move from the far East to the far West. Language barrier was the greatest
    obstacle I first encountered. Little did I know that there would be so many accents in English. However, I belive this
   is what broadening one's horizon means. There is no better way to utterly learn a culture than to live within.<br />
    Altough Many complain about the UK weather saying it's unpredictable and unpleasent, I am quite enjoying it. 
    I doubt anyone can withstand the stormy and rainy summer season in Hong Kong not to mention the scorching hot sun.
    In fact, the lovely people and the highly inclusive society here are what make me truly appreciate.
